### What Can Someone Do With My Key?

- ❌ Make API calls on your behalf

They CANNOT:
- ✅ Access your Google account
- ✅ Access your Gmail or other Google services
- ✅ See your personal information
- ✅ Make purchases or charges

### Best Practices

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key" Error

**Problem**: The API key doesn't work

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure you copied the entire key (starts with `AIzaSy`)
2. Check for extra spaces at the beginning or end
3. Try generating a new API key
4. Make sure the API key is enabled in Google AI Studio

### "Quota Exceeded" Error

**Problem**: You've hit the free tier limit

**Solutions**:
1. Wait until tomorrow (quota resets daily)
2. Upgrade to paid tier (optional, very cheap)
3. Create a new Google account for a new API key

### "API Key Not Working"

**Problem**: Key was working, now it's not

**Solutions**:
1. Check if the key was deleted in Google AI Studio
2. Verify the key is still enabled

## 💰 Do I Ever Need to Pay?

### For Personal Use: **NO**

The free tier is more than enough for:

You might need paid tier if:

**A:** Yes! Google provides a generous free tier with no expiration. You only pay if you exceed the free limits (which is rare for personal use).

**A:** No problem! Just generate a new one at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey and update it in Sunny AI.

### Q: Can I use Sunny AI without an API key?

**A:** No, an API key is required for the AI summarization features. However, you can use Ollama (local AI) instead of Gemini if you prefer.

### Q: Will my meetings be stored by Google?

**A:** Google may temporarily process your data for API requests, but they don't store your meeting content. Check Google's privacy policy for details.

### Q: Can I use multiple API keys?
